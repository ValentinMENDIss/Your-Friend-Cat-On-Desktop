## Your-Friend-Cat-On-Desktop

**Your Friend, Cat on Desktop** 😺 is your companion who will walk across your screen. 🖥️
    and delight you with his presence. He is very happy to be with you and to spend some time next to you, watching what you do.

This code was made as an opportunity to learn how the Pygame module works in the Python programming language and also its other capabilities. 
    **I hope you will like it :)** 🙂

What do you wait for?! Take care of a cat on your Screen :) !!!.

This is a Cat. He seems to be happy to see you :)
