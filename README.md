    # Your-Friend-Cat-On-Desktop

    **Your Friend, Cat on Desktop** is your companion who will walk across your screen 
    and delight you with his presence. He is very happy to be with you and to spend some time next to you, watching what you do.

    This code is an opportunity to better learn how the Pygame module works in the Python programming language and also its other capabilities. 
    **I hope you will like it :)**

    What do you wait for?! Take care of a cat on your Screen :) !!!.


   Have a nice day.
   Best wishes, Valentin.
